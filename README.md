#### :books: This is a study project in colab with SPC Brasil, all data used are fake but are in sight with the data they possess.
#### :running: The goal is to develop a business oriented product that can be of value to the company based on the data.
# So what is our product?
#### :pushpin: A dashboard that delivers a holistic vision of the vehicle financing scenario in order to provide market intel to vehicle dealers and possibly fabricators.
ps: it sounds cooler than we thought it would. 🤭

## About the solution

#### The resulting product emulates a backend processment of the data found in the SPC's database with Python. Then, delivers it to the frontend, witch is represented by the power BI solution.

#### The frontend is ready to be used for the data sample we recieved, simply open PI-BUREAL.pbix and enjoy. 

#### However, we implemented the possibility to update the data entry. (See the Getting Started section to know how it works)
